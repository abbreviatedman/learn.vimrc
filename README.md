# learn.vimrc

An attempt to make a .vimrc that's useful for learning vim.


### Principles

1. It should make vim prettier and easier to parse.
2. It should NOT change any of the fundamental behaviors of vim. The point is to learn the core language.
3. The only behavioral change is a handful of key mappings, which are small enough in number to quickly set for the session if you sit down at a strange computer.
4. But no leader key mappings that obscure the commands they stand in for. Understand what you're shortcutting for before you efficentize everything!
