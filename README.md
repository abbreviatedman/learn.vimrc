# learn.vimrc

An attempt to make a `.vimrc` configuration file that helpful for those beginning to learn `vim.`


### Principles

1. It should make `vim` prettier and easier to parse for those new to its look.
2. It should NOT change any of the fundamental behaviors of `vim`. The point is to learn the core language.
3. The only behavioral change is a handful of key mappings, which are small enough in number to quickly set for the session if you sit down at a strange computer.
4. But no mappings that obscure the commands they stand in for. Understand _what_ you're shortcutting for before you trim out the unnecessary keystrokes!
